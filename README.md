# Fake News Classifier 
##### This project attempts to classify a news article as fake or real using scikit=learn's PassiveAggressiveClassifier and the Tfidf Vectorizer

##### Also used the WordNetLemmatizer to normalize the text data.

##### Additional data was used, kindly change the paths to the csv files after obtaining them from the below links. This had to be done due to Github's file size restrictions.
